   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Getting started with IRX
========================
IRX can be installed easily by cloning the repo. 

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/souravsaha/irx.git

We also recommend to create a new conda environment to use the toolkit.

.. code-block::
   
   conda create -n irx python=3.9
   pip install .

Note that, IRX is built on top of Python 3.9 and Java 11. Other versions might work,
but thorough testing for newer Python versions is in progress.
